[1] Win The Future with Google’s AI Ads Notes
AI solutions are even more powerful when used together. For example, advertisers who adopt responsive Search ads in campaigns that also use broad match and Smart Bidding see an average of 20% more conversions at a similar cost per action, according to internal Google data.
Advertisers who use Google's AI across channels with Performance Max campaigns in their account see an average increase of 13% total incremental conversions at a similar cost per action, according to an internal Google study. Remember that these benefits can only be unlocked when budgets are unconstrained, allowing machine learning to drive maximum performance.
Identify your Objectives
	•	The first step to adopting any google AI solution is to align on the most relevant, impactful metrics for your business
	•	Identify business objectives and marketing metrics
	◦	Business objective → designed to drive and measure business results. such as revenue, profit, or market share.
	◦	Marketing metrics → align to business objectives such as
	▪	total revenue on add spend
	▪	profitability per dollar invested
	▪	number of quality customers aquired
	•	Ensure alignment across leadership
	◦	The leadership team including CMO and CFO should align on marketing metrics ideally before the beginning of a new year.
	◦	building communication & alignment between marketing and finance stakeholders,
	▪	drives clear message marketing efforts should be designed to drive the right results for the business.
	▪	not just towards intermediary metrics such as clicks or CPC (cost per conversion)
	◦	Work with your marketing and finance teams to showcase how modern marketing isn't an expense on your balance sheet but an investment that directly contributes to whatever business goals your company has — profit, revenue, or maybe lifetime value growth.
	▪	marketing ≠ expense, rather marketing = investiment
	◦	Later when activating against this marketing metric, make sure that your Smart Bidding strategy aligns most closely with your objective.
	◦	Optimizing Towards Value is a powerful way to drive incremental results for advertisers
	◦	According to Google internal data, advertisers who switch from a target CPA to a target ROAS bid strategy can see an average of 14% more conversion value at a similar return on ad spend
	•	Create Single source of Truth for measuring success
	◦	encourage your c-suite to create a set of joint KPIs between marketing and finance teams to track on a regular basis.
	◦	then build a single shared source of truth to help them measure against these to demonstrate impact of marketing on company performance.
	◦	most brands have a limited set of metrics (typically 5 to 10) that inform marketing investment decisions.
	◦	If your org is more advanced you may summarize their reporting on a strategic scorecard or dashboard.
Build a strong data strategy
	•	Drive the right metrics
	◦	Google’s AI works best with strategic human input including…
	▪	setting the right goal
	▪	fueling it with data and insights such as audience or seasonality.
	▪	data can also inspire new ideas
	◦	Google’s AI needs advertisers to instruct it with high quality data and correct guidance.
	◦	Privacy Safe data is the key to building a more sophisticated, impactful marketing strategy.
	◦	Data is $$ because
	▪	high quality → receive data straight from source, the customer.
	▪	Relevant → Data relates directly to products you sell and the customers who buy from you
	▪	Unique → no other company has the same customer data as you
Anchor a Data Strategy
	•	The data advertisers provide ML algorithms help shape and define how Google’s AI will perform.
	◦	The more accurate data an advertiser provides, the better trained the algo will be to deliver stronger results
	◦	When creating a first-party data strategy, root it in business objectives
	•	To make sure data links to goals, encourage C-suite to align with relevant teams in order to ensure you have the right customer experience and consent processes in place to let your teams access and use the data they need.
Examples of impactful data sources
	•	Offline Data
	◦	if your business involves offline sales or leads, use offline data to help optimize toward objectives,
	▪	not just e-commerce goals.
	•	Customer Segmentation Data
	◦	Telling your marketing engine who your high-value customer are is important to driving the results you desire.
	◦	If goal is to drive quality leads, segmenting customers by value can help ID even more customers like those who are already valuable.
	◦	This helps drive impact against your marketing metrics and business objectives.
	•	Profit Margin Data
	◦	identifying the value of your products and services in relation to one another helps you see where you need to focus to drive profit.
	◦	EG:
	▪	gross merchandise value
	▪	incremental active accounts
	▪	lifetime value
	▪	predictive lifetime value
	▪	12 month profitability
Build A Robust Database
	•	Algorithms don’t need a huge amount of data, they need the right data.
	•	To build a robust database and connect it to relevant platforms, google highlights three steps as follows…
	1	Build a robust first party DB to inform a business objective oriented marketing strategy
	•	Tech:
	◦	integrate marketing and data/customer management platforms to enable an automated flow of data.
	◦	Google’s Ad and Cloud Products help make faster, better decisions by combining previously siloed data to unlock insights that lead to timeley and relevant customer messaging. Surfacing behavioral predictions to help your advertiser invest more effectively in marketing.
	•	People
	◦	the key is to build infrastructure that breaks down the organizational silos and connect the dots between data within your org.
	◦	These teams can set up automated processes that allow for the seamless connection of data.
	▪	this is where a data scientist or data analytics team is important for connecting the data silos
	•	Process
	◦	stand up automated processes allowing for seamless connection of data
	◦	where possible USE YOUR OWN DATA.
	▪	the more processes and tech that are done in house, the more control you have within your ecosystem.
	▪	If your team doesn’t have the bandwidth, work with a 3rd party to measure business value within first-party data.
	1	Make sure your strategy is built to cultivate customer trust and use that trust to build relationships.
	•	Create fair value exchange with users & obtain consent to guide your data strategy.
	◦	Communicate a clear value proposition. Make it easy for customers to see benefits of sharing data with you.
	◦	Design neat and digestible consent forms. Be upfront and open about how data is used.
	▪	Let customers withdraw your access to their data at any time.
	◦	Comply with local regulations. Make time to ensure you understand how regulations might impact their business.
	▪	this helps deliver an ad experience that is inline with expectations of users / governing bodies.
	1	Develop a strategy to share first-party data across media platforms.
	•	Sharing first party data across media platforms enables better activation, measurement and optimization in campaigns.
	•	Bidding and conversion tracking
	◦	import data that is logged offline (in your database or CRM system) via enhanced conversions for leads, offline conversion import, store visits or store sales.
	•	Audience and activation
	◦	upload data manually through the Google Ads or DV360 APIs, or use Customer Match Uploader (CMU).
	◦	CMU connects to all top CRMs and customer data platforms (CDPs), and data onboarders that allow for seamless ingestion of data across Google Ads and Google Marketing Platform (GMP)
	▪	Accessible via API or UI via direct integrations or through Zapier.
	▪	Cloud service providers like GCP can help capture and organize the information shared by people during both online interactions like conversions, store visits, or phone calls.
	◦	Make sure this data is uploaded for 1 to 2 weeks before beginning to activate within campaigns to ensure all data is funneling into account properly & aligned with what you see internally.
Create a future proof measurement strategy
	•	Ensure you have a solid foundation of online conversion measurement.
	•	Correct measurement allows you to track conversion actions before setting up attribution and optimization with Smart Bidding.
	•	As best practice, implement the global site tag as well as Enhanced Conversions to minimize gaps when cookies aren’t available.
	•	For Google Ads conversions, advertisers may implement the following, based on their business objectives…
	◦	Online Sales → if measuring online sales with transaction specific values and use the Google tag, you can track transaction specific conversion values.
	▪	Also use **********************Tag Manager to deploy conversion tags with values.
	▪	If you use Google Analytics to measure web or app values, you can import your conversions into Google Ads conversion tracking
	◦	Lead generation → if you measure from lead generation campaigns that have been qualified or closed, you should implement enhanced conversions for leads
	◦	Offline Sales → If you measure the impact of your online ad spend with offline sales,  implement store sales measurement.
	◦	Other Offline Converions → If your conversion value is only available offline or in your customer relationship management (CRM) system, you can also import offline conversions from ad clicks into Google Ads.
Activate Everywhere with Google’s AI solutions
	•	Once ML knows what’s important to your business, it can help the brand show up at key impactful moments.
